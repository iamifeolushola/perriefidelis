# About Me 👩🏽‍🔬 👩🏽‍🎨 🥑
I am a product designer who helps companies, communities & organisations design, maintain & improve the quality of their products & overall experience, to match the needs of their target audience.

As a designer with a background in science(Microbiology), I like to tackle my design problems like a scientist. I fully understand the importance of all aspects of design and design with a balanced mindset that focuses on data, research and psychology. I believe the best experiences are created through a vivid understanding of the problem, continues iterations & experiments and guided by user feedback.

I believe so much in the essence of community & collaboration. I holds & reckon pertinently in the theory that, for every building, bricks & mortar are vital to the actualization of the structure, which entails collaboration & contribution. Hence, she has chosen to remain actively involved in strengthening communities around her, particularly in my areas of interests.
