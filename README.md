# About Me 👩🏽‍🔬 👩🏽‍🎨 🥑
I am a designer living in Nigeria 🇳🇬, with years of industry experience of helping organisations & communities design, build and maintain the quality of their products & grow design teams.

I believe so much in the essence of community & collaboration. Hence, I have chosen to remain actively involved in strengthening communities around me, particularly in my areas of interests. I hold & reckon pertinently in the theory that, for every building, bricks & mortar are vital to the actualisation of the structure, which entails collaboration & contribution.

In the past years, I have helped to build, maintain and grow some amazing communities, within and beyond Africa.
